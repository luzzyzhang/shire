Introduction
=============================

500 Lines or Less focuses on the design decisions that programmers make in the small when they are building something new. 

.. note::

    - Before reading each chapter, we encourage you to first think about how you might solve the problem.
    - What design considerations or constraints do you think the author is going to consider important?
    - What abstractions do you expect to see?
    - How do you think the problem is going to be decomposed?
    - Then, when reading the chapter, try to identify what surprised you.
    - It is our hope that you will learn more by doing this than by simply reading through each chapter from beginning to end.
